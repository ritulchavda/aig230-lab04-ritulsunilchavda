    "## Word Embeddings: Learning Meaning from Context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal of this lab:** learn how *continuous vector representations* (embeddings) are learned from data, and how they are used in practical NLP workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you should be able to:\n",
    "1. Explain **distributional semantics** (\"meaning from context\").\n",
    "2. Train word embeddings using **Word2Vec** and **FastText** (with Gensim).\n",
    "3. Use embeddings for **similarity search** and **analogy / vector algebra**.\n",
    "4. Visualize a word embedding space and interpret what you see.\n",
    "5. Explain why embeddings help with **sparsity** and **generalization** compared to n-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industry relevance (why you should care)\n",
    "Even in the era of transformers, embeddings remain widely used for:\n",
    "- **Semantic search** and query expansion  \n",
    "- **Similarity / recommendation** (nearest neighbors in vector space)  \n",
    "- **Clustering** and exploratory analysis  \n",
    "- Lightweight NLP systems where large models are too expensive"

    "Answer: \n",
    "1. The main limitation of one hot vectors is that they become very large and inefficient when the number of categories grows. This leads to high memory usage and sparse representations that do not capture any relationships or similarity between categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It means that meaning is not fixed inside individual words but forms from how words regularly appear together in context. When certain words repeatedly show up near each other our minds infer relationships concepts and intent from those patterns. In other words understanding grows from usage not from isolated definitions."

    "Answers:\n",
    "1. Even with high quality embeddings, analogies can fail because they are heavily dependent on the specific training data used. If the corpus is relatively small, like the 20 Newsgroups dataset used in this lab, the model might not see enough diverse examples of a relationship to map it as a consistent geometric direction. Additionally, words with multiple meanings can create noise, as the vector for a word like \"king\" might be pulled toward various unrelated contexts rather than just the gender or royalty dimension you are trying to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Analogy evaluation is an intrinsic measure that only tests the internal linguistic patterns of the vector space rather than the specific utility of the model for a real world application. A model might fail at solving formal analogies while remaining highly effective at practical downstream tasks like document classification or recommendation systems where broad topical relevance is more important than precise linear relationships."

   "source": [
    "Answer:\n",
    "1. Embeddings replace high dimensional sparse one hot vectors with low dimensional dense vectors that capture semantic meaning. Unlike one hot vectors where every word is mathematically perpendicular to others, embeddings place semantically related words close together in a continuous vector space. This enables models to recognize that terms like cat and dog are related, allowing for much better generalization even when an exact word match is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the tech industry, embeddings are widely used for building semantic search engines and recommendation systems. Instead of just matching keywords, these systems use embeddings to retrieve documents or products based on the actual meaning of a user query. This allows a search engine to understand that a user looking for a motel might also be interested in results for a hotel, significantly improving the relevance of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. FastText is the better choice when your dataset contains many typos, rare words, or technical jargon that might not appear frequently enough to learn a full word vector. Since FastText represents words as groups of character n grams, it can build a vector for a word it has never seen before by looking at its subword pieces. This makes it particularly effective for social media data or morphologically rich languages where words take many different forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. One major risk is that word embeddings often inherit and amplify social biases present in the training data, such as gender or racial stereotypes. Because the model learns strictly from co occurrence patterns, any prejudice in the source text becomes a geometric relationship in the vector space. Additionally, embeddings struggle with polysemy, as they typically assign a single vector to a word regardless of whether it has multiple distinct meanings like bank."
